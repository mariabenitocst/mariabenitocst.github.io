            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>Welcome to my webpage! I am a PhD student under the supervision of 
                <a href="http://www.ift.unesp.br/users/iocco/">Prof. Fabio Iocco</a> at the Instituto de Física Teórica 
               in São Paulo: a research institute for theoretical physics at Universidade Estadual Paulista.
               I am currently writing my thesis on the subject "The Milky Way, a Galaxy in LCDM".
               I obtained my Master's degree in elementary particles and cosmology at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid.
               So far, my work has been focused on dynamical studies of our Galaxy as a probe of the dark matter distribution in the Milky Way and a way of constraining modified gravity theories. 
               I am interested in galaxy formation & evolution models and the very nature of the dark matter particle.

            <h3>Research Interests</h3>
              <p> Our Galaxy, the Milky Way, is a benchmark for galaxy formation & evolution models and for experiments
                  that aim to understand the very nature of the dark matter particle. Due to our position within the 
                  Galactic plane at 8 kpc from the Galactic center, we have access to full phase-space information for a 
                  large number of individual stars. This allows
                  detailed studies of the different components that constitute our Galaxy and how they have come to be.
              </p>
              <p>
                  So far, my research has been focused on reconstructing the distribution of dark matter in our Galaxy 
                  by means
                  of the rotation curve, i.e. tracers in circular orbits around the Galactic center that probe the total
                  gravitational potential. As a member of the 
                  <a href="https://www.cta-observatory.org/">Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) collaboration</a>, 
                  I have been 
                  working in the characterisation of the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, 
                  50 kpc away from the center of our Galaxy, at TeV energies.
                  In the following, I describe some of the topics I am & have been recently involved 
                  in.

                <h4> Mass Distribution in the Galactic Bulge Region</h4>
                <p> Dark matter is a subleading component in the central region of our Galaxy (i.e. inner 3 kpc of the Galaxy)
                    which is dynamically dominated by baryons.
                    The actual content and density structure of the dark matter in such inner region 
                    is at the center of a long-standing debate on whether the 
                    dark matter profile of galaxies is "cored" or "cusped".
                    <!--Estimating the mass distribution in the Galactic bulge region 
                    has historically been a difficult undertaken mainly due to dust obscuration in the optical band.-->
                    Sizeble uncertainties on the actual shape and normalization of the stellar morphology 
                    mask away sound, general conclusions on the inner slope of the DM density profile, 
                    and both core and cusp DM density profiles are allowed.

                <h4> Particle Dark Matter Constraints: the Effect of Galactic Uncertainties</h4>
                    <p> 
                        The interpretation of indirect and direct dark matter searches depend on the adopted
                        dark matter density profile within the astrophysical target. Particularly, 
                        the reconstructed dark matter density in the Milky Way proceeds from astrophysical observations, 
                        all affected by quantifiable uncertainties. I have worked on a full data-driven analysis 
                        to quantify how actual uncertainties on the relevant astrophysical observations of such quantities 
                        (such as e.g. the Sun's Galactocentric distance) affect the interpretation of in/direct detection 
                        (or lack thereof).

                <h4> Testing Modified Gravity Theories with the Milky Way</h4>
                <p> 
                    Alternative proposals to explain the mismatch between the observed dynamical mass 
                    and that inferred by observations of the visible component, of
                    astrophysical objects over a large range of mass and spatial scales, relies on a 
                    modification of the theory of gravity.
                    The Milky Way offers an unique opportunity for testing modifications of gravity on the
                    scale of spiral galaxies by means of the observed rotation curve. By comparing the  
                    gravitational  potential  as  a  function  of  galactocentric  distance with the potential  
                    that  is  expected  to  be  generated  by  the  visible  component (stars and gas) only, 
                    we can test the validity of the underlying
                    gravity theory.

                <h4> Large Magellanic Cloud Studies with CTA</h4>
                    <p> 
                        The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is an active star forming galaxy.
                        This, together with its proximity and the fact that it is seen almost faced-on,
                        turns the LMC a valuable target for gamma-ray studies.
                        We studied the forecasts on detecting the already known gamma-ray sources (point
                        sources, individual extended sources and the diffuse emission produced by the
                        propation of cosmic rays within the source) in the 
                        LMC with the CTA's Southern Array.
                        We further characterised the signal expected due to dark matter annihilation
                        and the corresponding constraints on the dark matter particle parameter space.
