										<h3>About me</h3>
										<p>
												Welcome to my webpage! I am a Ph.D student under the supervision of 
												<a href="http://www.ift.unesp.br/users/iocco/">Prof. Fabio Iocco</a> at the Instituto de Física Teórica 
											   in São Paulo, a research institute for theoretical physics at Universidade Estadual Paulista.
											   <!---I am currently writing my thesis on the subject "The Milky Way, a Galaxy in LCDM".-->
											   I obtained my Master's degree in elementary particles and cosmology at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid.
											   So far, my work has been focused on dynamical studies in our Galaxy that aim to determine 
											   the dark matter distribution. 
											   I am interested in galaxy formation & evolution models and the very nature of the dark matter particle.
										</p>

									<h3>Research Interests</h3>
									<p>
											Our Galaxy, the Milky Way (MW), plays an important role for understanding galaxy formation & evolution.
											It is also a key element for experiments
											that aim to unravel the very nature of the dark matter particle. 
											Due to our position within the 
											Galactic plane, at 8 kpc from the Galactic center, we have access to full phase-space information for a 
											large number of individual stars. This allows
											detailed studies of the different components (i.e. stellar bulge, stellar disc, gas and stellar halo)
											that constitute our Galaxy and how they have come to be.
										</p>
										<p>
											My research has been focused on determining the distribution of dark matter (DM) in our Galaxy 
											by means
											of the rotation curve mass modelling. Objects in circular orbits aroung the Galactic center 
											trace the total gravitational potential. By subtracting to the observed velocities
											the expected velocities by the pure effect of gravity of the visible component
											(stars and gas), we can infer constraints on the distribution of dark matter. <br />
											A precise determination of the DM profile in our Galaxy is important
											for placing the MW in a cosmological context. <!-- and to understand whether the MW is or not a 
											peculiar galaxy. -->
											Confronting the observed DM distribution with results from zoom-in N-body 
											simulations might further help to understand the dynamical interplay between baryons and DM. 
											Furthermore, the distribution of DM in the MW is a key element for experiments that aim to unravel
											the very nature of the 
											DM particle.
										</p>
										<p>	
											As a member of the 
											<a href="https://www.cta-observatory.org/">Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) collaboration</a>, 
											I have been 
											working in the characterization of the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way,
											at TeV energies.
										</p>
										<p>
											In the following, I describe some of the topics I am & have been recently involved 
											in.

													<h4>Mass Distribution in the Galactic Bulge Region </h4>
													<p>Dark matter is a subleading component in the central region of our Galaxy (i.e. inner 3 kpc)
														which is dynamically dominated by baryons.
														The actual content and density profile of the DM in such region 
														is at the center of a long-standing debate on whether the 
														DM profile of galaxies is "cored" or "cusped".
														<!--Estimating the mass distribution in the Galactic bulge region 
														has historically been a difficult undertaken mainly due to dust obscuration in the optical band.-->
														Sizeable uncertainties on the actual shape and normalization of the stellar morphology 
														prevent drawing general conclusions on the inner slope of the DM density profile, 
														and both core and cusp DM density profiles are allowed.

													<h4>Particle Dark Matter Constraints: the Effect of Galactic Uncertainties </h4>
													<p>The interpretation of results from indirect and direct DM searches depends on the adopted
														DM density profile in the astrophysical target. Particularly, 
														the reconstruction of the DM profile in the MW proceeds from astrophysical observations, 
														all affected by quantifiable uncertainties. I have worked on a full data-driven analysis 
														that quantifies actual astrophysical uncertainties on the determination of the DM profile 
														in our Galaxy. The likelihood profile of this analysis is a practical tool to propagate 
														uncertainties on astrophysical quantities into the DM particle parameter space.

														<h4>Testing Modified Gravity Theories with the Milky Way </h4>
														<p>Alternative proposals to explain the mismatch between the observed dynamical mass 
															and that inferred by observations of the visible component rely on 
															modifications of the theory of gravity.
															The MW offers an unique opportunity for testing such modifications on the
															scale of spiral galaxies by means of the observed rotation curve. By comparing the  
															gravitational  potential  as  a  function  of  galactocentric  distance with the potential  
															that  is  expected  to  be  generated  by  the  visible  component only, 
															we can test the validity of the underlying
															gravity theory.

															<h4>Large Magellanic Cloud Studies with CTA </h4>
															<p>The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is an active star forming galaxy.
																This, together with its proximity and the fact that it is seen almost faced-on,
																turns the LMC a valuable target for gamma-ray studies.
																We have studied the forecasts on detecting already known gamma-ray sources 
																(i.e. point
																sources, individual extended sources and the diffuse emission produced by the
																propation of cosmic rays within the source) in the 
																LMC with the CTA's Southern Array.
																We have further characterized the gamma-ray signal expected from the LMC due to DM annihilation
																and the corresponding upper limits on the thermally-average DM self-annihilation
																cross-section as a function of the DM mass.
