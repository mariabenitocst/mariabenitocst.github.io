            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>Welcome to my webpage! I am a PhD student under the supervision of 
                <a href="http://www.ift.unesp.br/users/iocco/">Prof. Fabio Iocco</a> at the Instituto de Física Teórica 
               in São Paulo: a research institute for theoretical physics at Universidade Estadual Paulista.
               I am currently writing my thesis on the subject "The Milky Way, a Galaxy in LCDM".
               I obtained my Master's degree in elementary particles and cosmology at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid.
               So far, my work has been focused on dynamical studies of our Galaxy as a probe of the dark matter distribution in the Milky Way and a way of constraining modified gravity theories. 
               I am interested in galaxy formation & evolution models and the very nature of the dark matter particle.

            <h3>Research Interests</h3>
              <p> Our Galaxy, the Milky Way, is a benchmark for galaxy formation & evolution models and for experiments
                  that aim at understanding the very nature of the dark matter particle. Due to our position within the 
                  Galactic plane at 8 kpc from the Galactic center, we have access to astronomical observations that allow
                  detailed studies of the different components that constitute our Galaxy and how they have come to be.
              </p>
              <p>
                  So far, my research has been focused on reconstructing the distribution of dark matter in our Galaxy 
                  by means
                  of the rotation curve, i.e. tracers in circular orbits around the Galactic center that probe the total
                  gravitational potential. As a member of the 
                  <a href="https://www.cta-observatory.org/">Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) collaboration</a>, 
                  I have been 
                  working in the characterisation of the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way 
                  50 kpc away from the center of our Galaxy, at TeV energies.
                  In the following, I describe some of the topics I am & have been recently involved 
                  in.
