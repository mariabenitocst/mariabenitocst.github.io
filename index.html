										<p>
												Welcome to my webpage! 
												<br>
												I have a Master's degree in elementary particles and cosmology at Universidad Autónoma 
												de Madrid in Spain,
												where I am from.
												<br>
												I completed my Ph.D at the Instituto de Física Teórica 
												in São Paulo (IFT-UNESP/ICTP-SAIFR), under the supervision of 
												<a href="http://www.ift.unesp.br/users/iocco/">Prof. Fabio Iocco</a>. 
												<!--You can find a copy of my Ph.D thesis 
												<a href=https://repositorio.unesp.br/handle/11449/181227>here</a>.-->
												<!--, a research institute for theoretical physics at Universidade Estadual Paulista.--> 
											   <!---I am currently writing my thesis on the subject "The Milky Way, a Galaxy in LCDM".-->
											  <br>
											   So far, my work has focused on dynamical studies in our Galaxy. <!--that aim to determine 
											   the dark matter distribution. -->
											   I am broadly interested in galaxy formation & evolution models and 
											   the very nature of the dark matter particle.

									<h3>Research Interests</h3>
									<p>
											<!--The Milky Way (MW) plays an important role in experiments
											that aim to unravel the nature of the dark matter (DM) particle. 
											Furthermore, our Galaxy can help us understanding galaxy formation & 
											evolution models. -->
											Due to our position in the 
											Galactic plane of the Milky Way (MW), at 8 kpc from the Galactic center (GC), 
											we have access to full phase-space 
											information for a 
											large number of individual stars within the Galaxy. 
											This detailed view of the Galaxy allows
											studies of the different components (i.e. stellar bulge, stellar disc, gas and 
											stellar halo)
											that constitute our Galaxy and how these components have come to be.
										</p>
										<p>
											My research has been focused on determining the distribution of dark matter (DM) 
											in our Galaxy using kinematic tracers of the total gravitational potential.
								            <!--
											of the rotation curve (RC) mass modelling. 
											Objects in circular orbits around the GC 
											trace the total gravitational potential. By subtracting from the observed velocities
											the expected velocities for the visible component
											(stars and gas), we can infer constraints on the distribution of dark matter.-->
											The detailed knowledge of the DM distribution in our Galaxy is important for 
											understanding the interplay between baryons and DM in the processes involved in 
											galaxy formation and evolution. 
											It is further a key element for experiments that aim to directly or 
											indirectly detect the DM particle due to theoretically predicted non-negligible, 
											weak interactions between DM and Standard Model particles. 
											<!-- and to understand whether the MW is or not a 
											peculiar galaxy. -->
											<!--
											Confronting the observed DM distribution with results from zoom-in N-body 
											simulations might further help to understand the dynamical interplay between baryons and DM. 
											Furthermore, the distribution of DM in the MW is important for experiments that aim to unravel
											the nature of the DM particle.-->
										</p>
										<p>	
											As a member of the 
											<a href="https://www.cta-observatory.org/">Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) collaboration</a>, 
											I have been 
											working in the characterization of the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of 
											the MW,
											at TeV energies.
										</p>
										<p>
											In the following, I describe some of the topics I am & have been recently involved 
											in.

													<h4>Mass Distribution in the Galactic Bulge Region </h4>
													<p>The DM is a subleading component in the central region of our Galaxy (i.e. inner 3 kpc)
														which is dynamically dominated by baryons.
														The actual content and density profile of the DM in such central region 
														is at the center of a long-standing debate on whether the 
														DM profile of galaxies is "cored" or "cusped". 
														<!--Estimating the mass distribution in the Galactic bulge region 
														has historically been a difficult undertaken mainly due to dust obscuration in the optical band.-->
														Our ignorance about the morphology of the bulge and the 
														normalisation of the visible component prevents strong conclusions on 
														the DM distribution in the inner 3 kpc.

													<h4>Particle Dark Matter Constraints: the Effect of Galactic Uncertainties </h4>
													<p>The interpretation of results from indirect and direct DM searches depends 
														on the adopted
														DM density profile in the astrophysical target. Particularly, 
														the reconstruction of the DM profile in the MW proceeds 
														from astrophysical observations, 
														all affected by quantifiable uncertainties. 
														I have worked on a full data-driven analysis 
														that quantifies actual astrophysical uncertainties on the 
														determination of the DM profile 
														in our Galaxy. The likelihood profile of this analysis, available 
														<a href="https://github.com/mariabenitocst/UncertaintiesDMinTheMW">here</a>, 
														can be easily used to propagate 
														astrophysical uncertainties
														into the DM particle parameter space.

														<h4>Testing Modified Gravity Theories with the Milky Way </h4>
														<p>Alternative proposals to explain the mismatch between the observed dynamical mass 
															and that inferred by observations of the visible component rely on 
															modifications of the theory of gravity.
															The MW offers an unique opportunity for testing such modifications on the
															scale of spiral galaxies. 
															<!--By comparing the  
															gravitational  potential  as  a  function  of  galactocentric  distance with the potential  
															that  is  expected  to  be  generated  by  the  visible  component only, 
															we can test the validity of the underlying
															gravity theory.-->
															I have tested John Moffat's Modified Gravity theory (MOG) 
															by comparing the observed gravitational potential as a function of the 
															galactocentric distance with the potential generated by 
															the baryonic component under different <i>flavours</i> of the MOG theory. 
															We concluded that in none of its present formulation, the MOG theory is able 
															to explain the observed RC of the MW.

															<h4>Large Magellanic Cloud Studies with CTA </h4>
															<p>The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is an active star forming galaxy.
																This, together with its proximity and the fact that it is seen almost faced-on,
																turns the LMC a valuable target for gamma-ray studies.
																We have studied the forecasts on detecting already known gamma-ray sources 
																(i.e. point
																sources, individual extended sources and the diffuse emission produced by the
																propagation of cosmic rays) in the 
																LMC with the CTA's Southern Array.
																We have further characterized the gamma-ray signal expected from 
																the LMC due to DM annihilation
																and the corresponding upper limits on the thermally-average 
																DM self-annihilation
																cross-section as a function of the DM mass.
